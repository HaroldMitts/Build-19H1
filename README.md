There are some changes in the Appx Dependencies, but not a lot has changed in Windows

The 64-bit version of the Windows ADK has a bug where it cannot create a catalog file. This is a known issue for Microsoft, is documented in the release notes, and will be fixed in future release or updates.

Office now has apps pinned to a group in the Start menu, which is nice. Users who login to their Microsoft account during the Out of Box Experience will log right into the Office free web-based apps when they click the Start menu icons for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneDrive, but users who do not use a Microsoft account when completing the Out of Box Experience for Windows will be required to sign in before the free web-based apps are usable.
